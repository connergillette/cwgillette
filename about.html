                        I am a third-year student at the University of Washington. I grew up in Sammamish, Washington and went to Skyline High School, where I co-founded and co-captained (and in 2017, coached) the Ultimate Frisbee Club. I like playing Dota and learning new skills in my free time.
                        I consider myself a quick learner and easily self-motivated to learn new things and get stuff done.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> Ever since I was a little kid I've loved working with computers and learning about different ways to use them. In elementary school I taught myself how to program in C / C++, and in middle school I started looking at C++ and HTML /
                        CSS.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Lately I've been exploring interests in web design and web app development, and my work at <a href="http://seattlewebdesign.com" class="highlight" target="_blank">efelle creative</a> has helped hone my skills in that area.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> I constantly like to be in a state of learning, whether it be something that will help me academically, in my career, or in general. I hope to pursue opportunities in the future that will help me learn new things and do meaningful
                        work in the process.
